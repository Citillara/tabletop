## **Ritual of Sacrifice to Tharizdun**

This rule governs the act of making a sacrifice to Tharizdun, or entities masquerading as such, within the game. It involves a series of skill checks that determine the success of the ritual and the consequences thereof.

### **Skill Check Requirements**

The character performing the sacrifice must succeed on four skill checks against a Difficulty Class (DC) determined by the level or Challenge Rating (CR) of the creature involved in the ritual:

- **Dexterity (DEX) Check**
- **Intelligence (INT) Check**
- **Wisdom (WIS) Check**
- **Charisma (CHA) Check**

The DC for each check is calculated as follows: `DC = 8 + (Creature's Level or CR / 2, rounded down, minimum of 1)`.

### **Consequence Roll Modifiers**

The success of these checks influences the character's chance of a favorable outcome from the ritual, as follows:

- Each successful check adds **+10%** to the consequence roll for success.
- For every result that exceeds the DC by 5 or more, add an additional **+5%**.
- A natural 20 on any check adds **+20%** to the consequence roll for success.
- A natural 1 on any check results in the immediate failure of the ritual, wasting the sacrifice.

### **Consequence Roll**

After the skill checks, roll a d100 to determine the outcome of the sacrifice:

- **1 (Special Case):** The sacrifice genuinely reaches Tharizdun, potentially leading to long-term consequences.
- **2 to the calculated consequence roll:** The sacrifice goes to the devil (see below) or attracts the devil if a pact has not yet been made.
- **Normal Failure:** If the roll does not fall within the success range, roll a d4 to determine the outcome:
  - **1-2:** Nothing happens.
  - **3:** The tutelar god of the sacrifice is notified.
  - **4:** A random god involved in Tharizdun's imprisonment is notified.
- **96-100 (Critical Failure):** The sacrifice backfires, causing the ritualist to take **1d6 damage per creature level**. This damage cannot be mitigated.

### **Notes**

- The success range for the consequence roll is based on the cumulative bonuses from the initial skill checks.
- The ritual's complexity and the dire consequences of failure highlight the risks involved in dealing with such powerful and unpredictable forces.

This rule aims to provide a structured yet flexible framework for handling sacrifices, encouraging strategic thinking and role-playing while underscoring the inherent dangers of meddling with dark powers beyond mortal ken.

## **The Devil**

Name: Zilthrax, the Collector

Description: Zilthrax is a Falxugon who thrives in shadows and whispers, with a form that seems to constantly shift between that of a gaunt humanoid and a swirling mass of dark mist. Its eyes glow with a malevolent crimson light, and its voice echoes with multiple tones, as if a chorus of beings spoke at once. Zilthrax prefers to appear in dreams or through subtle manipulations rather than direct confrontation, making it all the more insidious.

Personality: Zilthrax is cunning, manipulative, and thrives on the spread of misery. It enjoys twisting the perceptions of mortals, leading them down the path of ruin with honeyed words and promises of power. Despite its chaotic nature, Zilthrax is a master strategist, capable of playing the long game to achieve its goals.
