## **Ritual of Sacrifice to Tharizdun**

In this scenario, Tharizdun is assumed to have beeen imprisoned by demons, devils, angels and gods due to the threat he represents. Check notes after for the keys locations.

### **Skill Check Requirements**

The character performing the sacrifice must succeed on four skill checks against a Difficulty Class (DC) determined by the level or Challenge Rating (CR) of the creature involved in the ritual:

- **Dexterity (DEX) Check**
- **Intelligence (INT) Check**
- **Wisdom (WIS) Check**
- **Charisma (CHA) Check**

The DC for each check is calculated as follows: `DC = 8 + (Creature's Level or CR / 2, rounded down, minimum of 1)`.

### **Consequence Roll Modifiers**

The success of these checks influences the character's chance of a favorable outcome from the ritual, as follows:

- Each successful check adds **+10%** to the consequence roll for success.
- For every result that exceeds the DC by 5 or more, add an additional **+5%**.
- A natural 20 on any check adds **+20%** to the consequence roll for success.
- A natural 1 on any check results in the immediate failure of the ritual, wasting the sacrifice.

### **Consequence Roll**

After the skill checks, roll a d100 to determine the outcome of the sacrifice:
**X** is the number of succeded sacrifices so far and cannot be greater than the **calculated consequence roll**

- **1 to X (Special Case):** The sacrifice genuinely reaches Tharizdun, potentially leading to long-term consequences.
- **X+1 to the calculated consequence roll:** The sacrifice goes to the devil (see below) or attracts the devil if a pact has not yet been made.
- **Normal Failure:** If the roll does not fall within the success range, roll a d4 to determine the outcome:
  - **1-2:** Nothing happens.
  - **3:** The tutelar god of the sacrifice is notified.
  - **4:** A random god involved in Tharizdun's imprisonment is notified.
- **96-100 (Critical Failure):** The sacrifice backfires, causing the ritualist to take **1d6 damage per creature level**. This damage cannot be mitigated.

### **Notes**

- The success range for the consequence roll is based on the cumulative bonuses from the initial skill checks.
- The ritual's complexity and the dire consequences of failure highlight the risks involved in dealing with such powerful and unpredictable forces.

## **The Devil**

Name: Zilthrax, the Collector

Description: Zilthrax is a Falxugon who thrives in shadows and whispers, with a form that seems to constantly shift between that of a gaunt humanoid and a swirling mass of dark mist. Its eyes glow with a malevolent crimson light, and its voice echoes with multiple tones, as if a chorus of beings spoke at once. Zilthrax prefers to appear in dreams or through subtle manipulations rather than direct confrontation, making it all the more insidious.

Personality: Zilthrax is cunning, manipulative, and thrives on the spread of misery. It enjoys twisting the perceptions of mortals, leading them down the path of ruin with honeyed words and promises of power. Zilthrax is a master strategist, capable of playing the long game to achieve its goals.

## **Special case : Meeting with Tharizdun**

The ritual culminates in a profound encounter with Tharizdun. As the sacrificial blade descends, extinguishing the life of the offering, the officiant's consciousness is enveloped in an oppressive, unyielding darkness. Suspended in this void, the character experiences neither hunger nor thirst and is deprived of all movement and sense of time.

After what feels like an eternity, faint glimmers begin to pierce the gloom, coalescing into a silhouette reminiscent of a mountain range. As the character focuses on this vista, the mountains begin to undulate, revealing themselves to be not stone but the shifting form of a colossal, planet-like entity: Tharizdun. The character perceives this planet turning ominously toward them, its surface a tapestry of evil incarnate. 

This encounter imprints Tharizdun's essence upon the officiant's mind and soul, marking them with an excruciating, indelible pain. The last image seared into the character's psyche before their return is that of innumerable chains binding this dark god.

Upon returning to their physical form, the character must immediately attempt a Wisdom saving throw:

- **Wisdom Save**: DC 25
- **Failure**: The character loses consciousness for 1d6+3 hours.

The character is then marked with a tattoo of Tharizdun's symbol: a black sphere, cracked and surrounded by chains, each chain linked to a lock and intertwined with thorns. There are 27 locks represented, corresponding to the god's planar bindings. Should any of these planar locks be undone, its corresponding lock on the tattoo will fade.

Next, the character must make a critical d100 roll based on their base attributes:

- **DC Calculation**: `(Intelligence + Wisdom) * 2`
- **Roll Conditions**: This roll is not subject to rerolls or influences from magical, supernatural, or natural abilities.

Following this roll, a new attribute—Sanity (SAN)—is established for the character, calculated as follows:

- **Success**: SAN begins at 100 - 1d10.
- **Failure**: SAN begins at 100 - 1d100.

The SAN attribute adheres to the rules from the Call of Cthulhu 7th edition, with one exception:

- **Restriction**: The character's SAN cannot exceed the initial value determined by the above method.

## Poem for locating the keys

The poem should be found by the characters but in incomplete/damaged state where some keywords/lines are missing.
The 7th stanza can not be found in any recording and only engraved on a stone where each key is guarded
The poem is celestian origin, so a character versed into poetics/celestial lore can figure that something is wrong if they find a version of the poem without the 7th stanza (Tharizdun's name itself is a taboo and only known to the oldest entities, original gods (newly ascended gods probably don't have knowledge), the guardians and a few comsic well versed characters. (DC 50 Knowledge) Most Tharizdun's followers have a mentor from whom they learnt the name.

### French version

En roiaumes de chaos ancien,
Quatre princes en sombre lien.
Chascun tient morceau, en obscur sien,
En Abisme, là où diables tien.

Nuef Enfers, là où ardents flambes,
Chascune couche ses clés enclambes.
Archediables gardent, en leurs ambes,
Secrets profonds, en noires rambes.

Sur mont de Celeste très haut,
Sept cieus touche l'azur, c'est l'mot.
En lumière divine, les clés en flot,
Gardés par ange, en éternel complot.

Par Elysée, quatre clés s'évadent,
En paradis, où âmes se lassent.
En terres paisibles, où héros guident,
Sous dôme d'étoile, la quête s'enracine.

Terres Fauves, embrassement de nature,
Trois nivaux cachés, en verdure pure.
En bois primal, la chasse assure,
Où bêtes et esprits en danse mûre.

Par trois fois, les clés entrelacent,
Trois fois trois, en couches, on trace.
Les trois ultimes, un dessein embrasse,
En ceste quête, votre sort se place.

Cherchiez-les en plans éloignés,
Par portails cachés, sous astres baignés.
Car en leur garde, liens sont dénoués,
Chaînes de Tharizdun, d'antan et projetés.

### English version

In realms of ancient chaos,
Four princes in dark accord.
Each holds a key, in his domain obscure,
In the Abyss, where devils ward.

Nine Hells, where fiery flames ascend,
Each layer its keys clasps tight.
Archdevils guard, in their grim arms,
Deep secrets, in darkest night.

On high Celestial mount,
Seven heavens touch the blue, so declared.
In divine light, the keys abound,
Guarded by angels, in eternal affair.

In Elysium, four keys break free,
In paradise, where souls do weary.
In lands of peace, where heroes lead,
Beneath the dome of stars, the quest deeply seeded.

Savage Lands, embrace of nature,
Three levels hidden, in verdure pure.
In primal woods, the hunt prevails,
Where beasts and spirits in mature dance twirl.

Thrice, the keys intertwine,
Three times three, in layers, aligned.
The final three, a purpose embrace,
In this quest, your fate is traced.

Seek them on distant planes,
Through hidden portals, under stars that bathe.
For in their keep, bonds break free,
Chains of Tharizdun, from ancient decree and lately conceived.
