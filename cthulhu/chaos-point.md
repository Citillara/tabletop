Here’s your **Chaos Points** rule polished for clarity, tone, and style — with improved Markdown formatting, typo cleanup, and reworded terms for flavor and coherence. I replaced *“No Farming”* with **“No False Omens”** and *“Retrocharge Safety Valve”* with **“Immediate Revelation Clause”**, both of which keep the intent but fit the Mythos tone.

## Optional Rule: Chaos Points

### **Overview**

Chaos Points represent a character’s desperate, one-time plea to the indifferent forces that govern the universe. It is an optional mechanic designed to embody the Lovecraftian idea that humanity’s fate is meaningless against the vast and uncaring cosmos.

Each investigator possesses a single **Chaos Point** — a metaphysical key they can use only once, opening the door to pure chance. In doing so, they invite either impossible salvation or annihilation.

---

### **Mechanics**

#### **Allocation**

Each player character begins play with **one Chaos Point**.
This point is unique, non-transferable, and may be used **only once** in the character’s lifetime. Once spent, it is gone forever.

---

#### **Eligibility — First Exposure**

A character cannot invoke a Chaos Point until they have been **directly exposed to the Unnatural.**
This requirement is fulfilled by any **one** of the following:

1. The character **loses Sanity** due to an **Unnatural** source;
2. The character possesses **≥ 01% Cthulhu Mythos** skill;
3. The Keeper assigns an **Exposure Tag** following a scene of undeniable Mythos contact (direct sighting, tangible aftermath, invasive dream or possession, or interaction with a Mythos artifact).

**Amnesia Clause:** Forgetting or repressing the experience does not remove eligibility once it has been earned.

**No False Omens:** Trivial occult hoaxes, rumors, or mundane shocks never qualify. The Keeper’s judgment is final.

**Immediate Revelation Clause:**
If a character’s *first exposure* occurs during a moment of crisis and they declare the use of a Chaos Point **in that same scene**, they are considered eligible **for that declaration.**

---

#### **Activation**

At a pivotal moment, a player may declare their intent to use their Chaos Point.
This declaration **replaces** any roll — skill, Luck, or otherwise — that would determine the immediate outcome.
The player surrenders all control to fate.

---

#### **Resolution**

Upon declaration, the player rolls **1d100** in full view of all participants.
The Keeper interprets and narrates the result according to the following table.
The cosmos does not favor mortals — its mercy is random, its cruelty deliberate.

| Roll       | Outcome                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1–5**    | **Miraculous Intervention** | The outcome is impossibly favorable — a one-in-a-million event that defies logic. The investigators not only succeed but gain a lasting advantage. <br>*(e.g., The Great Old One is not merely banished, but sealed for a generation.)* |
| **6–30**   | **A Favorable Twist**       | The result is clearly beneficial. The immediate danger is overcome or averted by chance. <br>*(e.g., The cult’s ritual collapses as the structure caves in, saving the investigators.)*                                                 |
| **31–75**  | **A Terrible Price**        | The goal is achieved — but at a dreadful, ironic cost. Success invites unforeseen horror. <br>*(e.g., You find the spell that can end the nightmare, but casting it costs you 1d20 permanent Sanity.)*                                  |
| **76–95**  | **Dire Consequences**       | The action fails and worsens the situation, birthing a new and immediate peril. <br>*(e.g., Your attempt to hide knocks over a lantern, setting the asylum ablaze.)*                                                                    |
| **96–100** | **Catastrophic Ruin**       | The worst conceivable outcome. The failure reverberates through the campaign or the world itself. <br>*(e.g., The ritual not only fails but anchors the entity to this plane — perhaps within one of the investigators.)*               |

---

### **Narrative Integration**

The invocation of a Chaos Point should feel like reality tearing at the seams. The air stills, colors twist, and distant sounds echo from impossible places.
Whether triumph or tragedy follows, it is not justice or punishment — merely the blind arithmetic of the cosmos unfolding.

---

### **Guidelines for Keepers**

* **Embrace the Twist:**
  The “Terrible Price” result is the soul of this mechanic. Seek the most ironic, tragic, or horrifying way a wish might be granted.

* **Collaborative Misfortune:**
  For a “Terrible Price,” consider briefly involving the player:
  *“You push the ghoul into the abyss — what precious thing slips from your pocket as you do?”*

* **Enduring Consequences:**
  The aftermath of a **1–5** or **96–100** result should linger. Let it alter the campaign’s trajectory, serving as a permanent reminder of the day the investigators gambled with eternity.
